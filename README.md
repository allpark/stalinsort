# Stalinsort

## What is Stalinsort?

It's a single-pass O(N) sorting algorithm. 

## How does it work?

You iterate down the list of elements checking if they're in order.
Any element which is out of order is eliminated. 
At the end you have a sorted list.

# Use 

```python

stalinSort(x) # where x is an array of numerical elements 

```
